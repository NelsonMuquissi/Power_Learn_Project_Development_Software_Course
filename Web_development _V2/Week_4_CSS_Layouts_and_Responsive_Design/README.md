Every HTML element is a box with:
- `Content` → `Padding` → `Border` → `Margin`

### 3. Display Property
- `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`
- `flex`, `grid` (modern layouts)

### 4. Positioning
- `static` (default)
- `relative`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`
- `sticky`

## 🔧 Flexbox – One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox is ideal for arranging items in a row or column:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

🔳 CSS Grid – Two-Dimensional Layout
Grid helps organize content into rows and columns:

css
Copy
Edit
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}
📱 Responsive Web Design (RWD)
Why it matters:
Enhances user experience

Improves SEO

Ensures cross-device compatibility

Core Techniques
✅ Fluid Layouts
Use relative units like %, em, vw, and rem.

✅ Flexible Media
css
Copy
Edit
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
✅ Media Queries
Apply CSS rules conditionally based on screen size:

css
Copy
Edit
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
✅ Mobile-First Design
Design for smaller screens first, then scale up using min-width queries.

💡 Best Practices
Use clean, well-commented CSS

Use semantic HTML5 (<header>, <main>, <section>, etc.)

Combine Flexbox and Grid effectively

Test on real devices and browsers
