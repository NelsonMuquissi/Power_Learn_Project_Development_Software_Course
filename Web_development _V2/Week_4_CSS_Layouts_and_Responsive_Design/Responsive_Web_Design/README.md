# 🧩 CSS Layouts & Responsive Web Design – Assignment

## 🎯 Objective
Build a responsive multi-section webpage using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**. Ensure content adjusts seamlessly across devices.

## 📚 What You'll Practice
- Flexbox (1D layouts)
- CSS Grid (2D layouts)
- Media queries
- Responsive units: %, rem, vw, etc.
- Content structure and flow

## ✅ Requirements

1. Layout includes: Header, Navbar, Main Content, Sidebar, Footer
2. Use Flexbox for sections (e.g., cards or navbar)
3. Use CSS Grid for page layout (main/sidebar)
4. Responsive design:
   - Mobile (single column)
   - Tablet
   - Desktop (multi-column)
5. No frameworks—only raw HTML & CSS

## 📁 Deliverables
- `index.html` – Semantic structure
- `style.css` – Clean, responsive CSS with comments

## 🛠 Tips
- Start with mobile-first
- Use `min-width` breakpoints for scale-up
- Use `gap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` for spacing/alignment
- Add media queries at logical breakpoints (e.g., 600px, 768px, 1024px)

Good luck and have fun with your layout!
